[![Install in CSS Hat](http://img.shields.io/badge/install-to%20CSS%20Hat-blue.svg)](http://addons.csshat.com/?install=csshat/middleware-scale) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/csshat/middleware-scale.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/csshat/middleware-scale)

This middleware scales all size values of layer by amount defined in settings.

## Example workflow

You are coding a retina PSD where everything is twice as big as you need it declared in your stylesheet. Just activate this middleware and set the scale amount to 50% and you are done.
